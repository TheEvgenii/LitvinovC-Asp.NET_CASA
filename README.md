For this function, I used C# as my programming language.
The function's job is to tell the user if the number is prime or not. 
To do this, the number has to be greater than one, to find this out, I used the conditional operator "If statement" to check this specific condition.
Afterward, I divided the number by only one, and by itself, I also used a loop to check whether N can be divided by numbers from 2 to N-1.

If the number passed as an argument to this specific method, it is considered prime, otherwise, the method returns true and false.

In the cases when we need to perform this algorithm for numbers from a certain range, it is faster to use the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm.

This algorithm is designed to analyze and determine prime numbers by progressively searching and disregarding composite numbers, which optimizes the function and performs its task faster and more efficiently. 

I used YouTube resources and this web site with Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm https://cp-algorithms.com/algebra/sieve-of-eratosthenes.html cplusplus.com/.

Please let me know if there are any issues with my assignment, and if you need something else from me. 

Thank you in advance.

Best regards,
